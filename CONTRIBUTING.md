## How you can contribute to The LC-DL App Repository
You can contribute to The LC-DL App Repository in many ways, the easiest is by submitting a simple app request, this page will give you all the info you need to contribute!

### App Requests
You can request an app you want to be added to the repository by filling out [The LC-DL App Request Form](https://forms.gle/KCDFcWtzJNs9W3n7A). Depending on the amount of requests, it may take some time for yours to be seen, you can speed up and *almost* **guarentee** this process by uploading the .ipa file of your app.

NOTE: Requesting an app **does NOT** mean that it will for sure be added to The LC-DL App Repository.

### App Submissions
You can submit an app to The LC-DL App Repository by sending me a DM on Discord (@sinceohsix). Submitting an app basically guarentees it will eventually be added, though it may still take some days, I am a fairly busy person.

To submit an app, it must already be installed in LiveContainer, for *my* convenience I will only accept apps that are in .app format or are compressed .app files that are a .zip. If you only have the .ipa, please use the request form.
